# electron-learning

This repository heavily focuses on learning Electron framework from beginner to a level that enables the development of scalable desktop applications confidently.

# Curriculum details below

Great! Since you have prior experience, we can move faster and focus on reinforcing concepts rather than explaining basics. Here's how I'd structure the lessons:

## **Lesson Structure (5-7 Sessions)**

### **Lesson 1: Foundation & Project Setup (Refresher)**

- Quick recap of Electron architecture (main vs renderer processes)
- Setting up a basic Electron app from scratch
- Package.json configuration and electron-builder basics
- **Mini-project**: "Hello World" app with proper structure

### **Lesson 2: Process Communication & IPC**

- Main process vs Renderer process roles
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) - `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer`
- Context isolation and preload scripts
- **Mini-project**: Build a simple note-taking app with IPC communication

### **Lesson 3: Window Management & Menus**

- BrowserWindow API and options
- Creating custom menus (application menu, context menu, tray)
- Window state management (minimize, maximize, close)
- Multiple windows and window communication
- **Mini-project**: Multi-window app with custom menu bar

### **Lesson 4: File System & Native APIs**

- File operations (reading/writing files)
- Dialog API (open, save, message boxes)
- Accessing Node.js modules from renderer
- **Mini-project**: File manager or text editor app

### **Lesson 5: Advanced Features**

- Native notifications
- System tray integration
- Auto-updater
- Global shortcuts
- **Mini-project**: Background app with system tray

### **Lesson 6: Security & Best Practices**

- Context isolation (deep dive)
- Content Security Policy
- Avoiding common security pitfalls
- Code organization patterns
- **Mini-project**: Refactor previous project with security best practices

### **Lesson 7: Building & Distribution**

- electron-builder configuration
- Creating installers for Windows/Mac/Linux
- Code signing
- Auto-update implementation
- **Final project**: Package and distribute a complete app

## **Learning Approach**

Each lesson would follow this pattern:

1. **Quick concept review** (10-15 min)
2. **Hands-on coding** (30-40 min)
3. **Mini-project/exercise** to solidify learning
4. **Common pitfalls** to watch out for
